=======

This is a IETF Softwires Working Group MAP (MAP-E and MAP-T) Python 3 module.  It currently accepts BMR entry in using either or both "Sharing Ratio" and "EA length."  It can also calculate the PSID by BMR and session IPv4 port.  Session end-user IPv6 PD and MAP CE address can be calculated by supplied BMR, IPv4 session port, and IPv4 session address.
